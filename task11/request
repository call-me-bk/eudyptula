Hi, sorry to bother you but i am facing a few issues with task 11,
and it would be really helpfull if you are willing to help me out.

1) I do not use a lot of external hardware with my laptop
(which happens to be the only computer I use) and to test the driver with
something i am using, it would either be an ethernet cable,
or a usb storage device, or a usb keyboard. what i mean to ask is,
i was unable to find the use of sysfs (the static int create_sysfs_attrs)
with either of these drivers. Am i supposed to go about it this way?
or can i do it with any driver that came along when i compiled the kernel?
(i can include all drivers that way and it would kill the purpose of this task)

2)I could notice that drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c was using the above mentioned piece of code already
but i do not use a device that requires this driver.

please let me know if i am doing something terribly wrong, because it would be easy to make a patch
to ftdi_sio.c but it doesn't serve the purpose.

also, i am going to attatch a patch i made to r8169 because i figured out my realtek ethernet connector uses this driver.

please tell me if this was way too much to ask

I apologize if my message was hurtful / disrespectfull in any manner,
thank you for reading this message.
